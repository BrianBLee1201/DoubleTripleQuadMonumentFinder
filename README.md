# DoubleTripleQuadMonumentFinder

DoubleTripleQuadMonumentFinder is a **high-performance Minecraft Java Edition Double/Triple/Quad Ocean Monument finder** designed for **very large search ranges**. This tool is optimized for **speed, parallelism, and correctness**.

Typically, players build an endgame portal-based Guardian farm, which is super fast. They usually require having an AFK point. But sometimes there are other neighboring monuments within 128 block radius, so players can take advantage of building 2, 3, or 4 same farms to increase 2x, 3x, or 4x the rates respectively. This tool answers a more practical question:

> Given my seed and specific search ranges, does my world have double, triple, or quad monuments? If so, what are the AFK points?
